# rls - minimalistic release

Inspired by https://github.com/zeit/release, but less features, more minimalistic.

## What's it good for?

Just release new versions of your package. Creates a git tag and adjusts your package.json, that's all.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g rls

## Usage

    $ rls

With options for semantic versioning:

    $ rls --minor

    $ rls --major
